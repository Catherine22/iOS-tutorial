#  Xylophone

## Our Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sounds and use AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great application developer is being able to solve your own problems and find out how to use existing tools by reading the documentation. So we’ll teach you exactly that so that when you graduate and start making your own apps, you’ll know how to program the features you want in your own app.


## What you will create

You will be making your first musical instrument! Musical apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. We’re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. Get it? Ok, the jokes are bad, but remember, I only wrote the good ones ...

## What you will learn

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* How to use tags in Interface Builder.
* Error handling using try and catch.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging for array index out of range errors.
